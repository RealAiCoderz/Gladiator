---Python Gladiator project by Rupesh---

The Good:
- Demonstrates all 6 basic concepts :
	1. separation of concern
	2. validation
	3. logging
	4. exception handling
	5. database connection
	6. testing.
- Many files each with small amount of code, rather than vice versa. For easy tracking.
- Follows naming conventions for methods, classes, and modules.
- Follows "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) methodology.
- Partly 4 out of 5 questions were shown in the first iteration in the first demo class.
- This 3rd iteration might be a decent starting point for future projects(?)

The Bad:
- Not everything is covered by error handling.
  (but sufficiently implemented to show capability)
- Not all units are covered by Testing.
  (but sufficiently implemented to show capability)
- MVC design pattern is followed but their roles might be a bit mixed.
- This projects answers only level-1 mathematical/analysis questions.
  (mainly because the focus of this project was code structure and implementation of concepts.)

Thank you.
